This repository contains a Perl script demonstrating an unusual behavior with the foreach loop and the last statement. The script iterates through an array of numbers and prints each number until the number 5 is encountered. At this point, the last statement terminates the loop, and the remaining numbers are not printed. The solution shows how to achieve the desired behavior of iterating through the entire array while printing.
